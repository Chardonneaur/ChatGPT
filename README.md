# Matomo ChatGPT Plugin

## Description

This plugin has been created in order to integrate ChatGPT into Matomo as a widget. It is nothing complicated, it just
consists in writing your prompts through the Matomo User Interface rather than using ChatGPT. 

The difference is that it is using here the ChatGPT API rather than the ChatGPT User Interface. 

In order to get started, you need to create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys -> Then you add this token into Personnal Settings
in Matomo -> Then you add the widget and you are good to go.
